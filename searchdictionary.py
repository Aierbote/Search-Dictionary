"""
This is the exercizeVers-1.1
Feature of matching words like Delhi or Paris

Command Line Interface program to search a word in a data.json dictionary,
made as an exercize during The Python Mega Course
#    https://www.udemy.com/gift/the-python-mega-course/
by Ardit Sulce on Udemy

This version is a bit messy, cause that's how I figured out the exercize

##      INSTRUCTIONS
## Enter any words you need to look for and answer Y or N when
## comfirmation is required.
## To stop it any time enter '\end' (without quotes)
##      almost anytime :think:
##      FIXED: ANYTIME ;-) ðŸ˜‰
##
## It's not case sensitive.
## Unless your word is Capitalized (as a city) or Title Case (New York)

In the future I might be even extending it or tweaking it abit

Later on the course even to make it useful in webapplication or with a
Graphical Interface or work with a database instead of dataset for
optimal execution timing for loads of data.
