# Search-Dictionary

This is the vers-1 

Command Line Interface program to search a word in a data.json dictionary, made as an exercize during [The Python Mega Course](https://www.udemy.com/gift/the-python-mega-course/) by Ardit Sulce on Udemy.

This version is a bit messy, cause that's how I figured out the exercize.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Run `python3 searchdictionary.py` from same folder.

Enter any words you need to look for and answer Y or N when
comfirmation is required.

It's not case sensitive.

Unless your word is Capitalized (as a city) or Title Case (New York).

To stop it any time enter `\end` (FIXED, it works ANYTIME ðŸ‘‹).

## Future

I might be even extending it or tweaking it a bit, cause later on the course it will be useful in webapplication or with a Graphical Interface or work with a database instead of dataset for optimal execution timing for loads of data.
